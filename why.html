            <p><strong>Why no bake cheesecake?</strong> I choose this recipe because it's the only dessert I know how to make. My mom has been using this recipe for a long time and it never disappoints. This recipe is very flexible in terms of taste you are looking for. Blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, cherry, match etcâ€¦ Cheesecake is my favorite dessert and although no bake cheesecake is a lot softer and different in texture compared to regular cheesecake, I love them both. I think this recipe is ideal for someone looking for a fun simple recipe to make with friends or solo. The ingredients and materials needed to make the recipe are very simple and the cheesecake can be cut into multiple pieces which makes it great for any sort of outing or event or party. Check out this recipe if you love cheesecake!</p>
